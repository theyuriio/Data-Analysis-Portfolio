## Yurii Riabkov - Portfolio
## About
I am passionate about uncovering patterns in data and transforming them into clear, actionable insights. My toolkit includes statistical analysis, data processing, and database engineering, backed by hands-on experience in SQL and Python.

I specialize in:

- Writing optimized SQL queries for data extraction and transformation

- Performing exploratory data analysis using Python (Pandas, NumPy)

- Applying statistical methods to validate findings and build predictive models

- Designing efficient database structures and ETL pipelines

My work focuses on delivering accurate, well-documented results that support data-driven decision making. I combine technical skills with business understanding to create solutions that are both robust and practical.
